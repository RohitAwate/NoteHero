# NoteHero
NoteHero is a web application for building, viewing, organizing, searching and annotating your notes.

## Features
- **Markdown + mermaid.js + KaTeX**: Use the syntax-light Markdown for textual content, draw sophisticated diagrams with mermaid.js and write that math beautifully  with KaTeX. You'll want to stare at your notes all day.
- **No centralized storage**: Whenever you commit changes, NoteHero pulls your Markdown code from your favorite Git service.
- **Powerful search**: NoteHero was built by developers for personal use and we love our keyboards! Thus, it comes with a powerful search engine equipped with fuzzy search. Type whatever you want: tags, titles, or any snippet from your notes and NoteHero will find it for you.
- **Annotation**: Add line-by-line comments to your notes.
- **sudo mode**: Select which notes to keep private and which ones to make public. As simple as adding a Boolean field to your YAML frontmatter.
- **Themes**: Switch between themes on the fly!
- **Exporter**: Need your notes offline? Want to print them? Easily export to Markdown or PDF.
